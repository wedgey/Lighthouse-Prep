				<h2>Beef Brisket Pot Roast</h2>
				<img src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/beef-brisket-pot-roast-horiz-a-1200.jpg" />
				<p>Beef brisket is a fabulous cut of meat. The brisket is located between the shoulders and the forelegs of the steer; these muscles get a work-out, and they are also well marbled with fat.</p>
				<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
				<ul class="ingredients">
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">4-5 pound beef brisket</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">Salt</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1-2 Tbsp olive oil</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">3 large onions, sliced</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">5-6 garlic cloves, minced</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 sprig thyme</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 sprig rosemary</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">3-4 bay leaves</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">2 cups of beef stock</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">2-3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 Tbsp mustard (optional)</label></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Directions:</h3>
				<ol class="directions">
					<li class="active">
						<p><strong>Prepare the brisket for cooking:</strong> On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.</p>
						<p>Using a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.</p>
						<p>Salt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Sear the brisket:</strong> You'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.</p>
						<p>Pat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)</p>
						<p>Turn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Sauté the onions and garlic:</strong> When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil.</p>
						<p>Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Sauté, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven:</strong> Preheat the oven to 300°F. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.</p>
						<p>Move the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop.</p>
						<p>Cover the pot, place the pot in the 300°F oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Add carrots, continue to cook:</strong> After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil:</strong> When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Make sauce (optional):</strong> At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.</p>
						<p>To make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Slice the meat across the grain:</strong> Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the "grain" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices.</p>
						<p>Serve with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles or polenta.</p>
					</li>

				<h2>Ancho Chile, Shrimp, and Pasta</h2>
				<img src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ancho-chile-shrimp-pasta.jpg" />
				<p>You know one of the great things about being a home cook? You can basically do whatever you want in your kitchen. Mix up cuisines. Pair unlikely foods. As long as it tastes good and you like it, no great uber-chef in the sky is going to look aghast and tell you you can’t do what you’ve just done. Thank goodness! Case in point, this quick and easy pasta dish from my friend Peg Poswall. Ancho chiles (dried poblano chili peppers) are distinctively Mexican. Parmesan? That would be Italian. Tossed together with pasta and shrimp? Huh?</p>
				<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
				<ul class="ingredients">
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">8 ounces long, thin pasta such as spaghetti or fettucini</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">Salt</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1/2 cup vegetable oil (grapeseed or canola)</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">3 thinly sliced cloves garlic</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 ounce (about 2 medium to large) dried ancho chiles, rinsed, seeded and deveined</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1/2 pound 21-25 count raw shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed, the shrimp pieces cut into thirds</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">Black pepper</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">Freshly grated Parmesan</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">Lime or lemon juice, fresh squeezed</label></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Directions:</h3>
				<ol class="directions">
					<li class="active">Put a large pot of salted water on to boil for the pasta when you start this recipe. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and cook until al dente. While the water is coming to a boil and while the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe as follows.</li>
					<li>Heat oil in a small skillet on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add sliced garlic. Cook until lightly browned, then remove with a slotted spoon to a large bowl.</li>
					<li>Thinly slice the ancho chiles (can chiffonade as you would with basil, just roll up into a cigar shape and slice crosswise). Add the sliced chiles to the hot oil and cook ONLY for 20 to 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the garlic. Do not over-cook the chiles or they will get bitter.</li>
					<li>Add the raw shrimp to the pan with the now chile and garlic infused oil. Increase the heat to high, cook for a couple minutes, stirring frequently, until the shrimp is just turning pink. Remove from heat. Add the shrimp and oil to the bowl with the garlic and chiles.</li>
					<li>Add the drained, cooked pasta to the bowl with the shrimp, garlic, chiles, and oil. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper and toss to combine. To serve, portion out into bowls, sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan and a little lemon or lime juice.</li>

				<h2>Artichoke Lemon Dip</h2>
				<img src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/artichoke-lemon-dip-vertical-600.jpg" />
				<p>Do you find artichoke dips dangerous? Do you suffer from self control issues when encountering a particularly compelling dip? Yah, me neither. I don’t know anyone like that.<br/>
				Of course if I were to have this problem, and ahem, I don’t, I would certainly try to stay away from this artichoke lemon dip.
				I wouldn’t serve it with crackers, or spread it onto toasted bread, or dip into it with toasted pita, chips, or celery sticks, or dip my fingers into it when no one is looking.<br/>
				No siree Bob, I would take one glance and run the other way. Because this dip, with artichoke hearts, lemon, parsley, Parm, and cream cheese, is just too good to resist.
				</p>
				<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
				<ul class="ingredients">
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 14-ounce (400 g) can of artichoke hearts, packed in water, drained</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1/4 cup (25 g), packed, grated Parmesan cheese</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 Tbsp lemon zest</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 clove garlic, minced (about 1 teaspoon)</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1/2 teaspoon fresh black pepper</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">1/4 teaspoon salt</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">8 ounces (225 g) cream cheese, room temperature</label></li>
					<li><label><input type="checkbox">3 to 4 Tbsp lemon juice</label></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Directions:</h3>
				<ol class="directions">
					<li class="active">Put the drained artichoke hearts, parsley, Parmesan, lemon zest, garlic, and salt and pepper in a food processor.  Pulse a few times until a paste forms. You should still be able to make out bits of parsley and lemon, so don't over-process it.</li>
					<li>Place the cream cheese in a medium sized bowl.  Add the artichoke parsley mixture and the lemon juice.  Stir until well blended.  Add more salt, pepper,  and lemon juice to taste.  Garnish with a few fresh leaves of parsley or ribbons of lemon zest.</li>
